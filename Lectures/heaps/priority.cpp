/* 
priority queues,
    often compare their objects 
    Idenity priority
    comparing keys
        reflexive k <= k
        antisysmmetric if k1 <= k2 and k2 <= k1; then k1 == k2
        transitive if k1 <= k2 and k2 <= k3 then k1 <= k3
        (can be put on a linear line)


    ADT Priority queue
    - the highest priority is removed first
    Eg
        insert(e)
        min() or max()
        remove()
        size()
        empty()

    Keys determine a total order
